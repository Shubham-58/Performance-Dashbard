# Performance-Dashbard
Performance Dashboard of a Hypothetical Store

This is a attempt at creating performace dashboard.
I've tried to create a Executive Summary type Dashboard and another one in the same file just for the aesthetics 


This was one of my earliest project when I started using Power Bi. More like a guided project. But recently I tried to give it my own shape. Basically its a demonstration of usage of different chart types, such as Funnel Chart, Clustered Column Chart, Maps, KPIs, Treemap and Tooltips.

This dashboard can assist stakeholders or CEOs in understanding their business' key financial metrics, like Revenue and Profit. Along with it, the visualizations used in these projects can guide in understanding key areas- States, Cites, generating highest revenue and profit. 
It answers questions like which states generate most amount of profit, how much revenue is generated by specific cities using interactive maps, and revenue by categories and subcategories, and what is most preferred payment method by customers.

Take a look and let me know if y'all got any suggestions or feedbacks.
Files titled Details and Order, contains cleaned CSV data.


Would recommend opening this file in Power Bi and watch the filters work their wizardry‚Äîabracadabra, data drama!üßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
